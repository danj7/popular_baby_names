# Popular Baby Names
In this project I will analyze trends in baby names for the United States from 1880 to 2018. The data is freely available from the Popular Baby Names datasets page located at https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html.

## Names, comings and goings

We often have the notion of an _old-sounding_ name, maybe because it's a name that reminds us of an elder relative or a historical figure. We also notice the reverse, that there are _modern-sounding_, newer, that may have recently come into fashion. I will explore these notions a little bit in this project, starting from the comings and goings of names.

First, I want to explore the changes year to year of the most popular names. To do this visually, I will use a word clouds, one for male names and another for female names.
