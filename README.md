# Popular Baby Names
In this project I will analyze trends in baby names for the United States from 1880 to 2018. The data is freely available from the Popular Baby Names datasets page located at https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html.

## Names, comings and goings

We often have the notion of an "old-sounding" name, as in a name we haven't heard in a long time, or maybe because it reminds us of an elder relative. We also notice the reverse, that there are names that sound modern, or newer, or that maybe have come into fashion. I will explore these notions a little bit in this project, starting from the comings and goings of names.
